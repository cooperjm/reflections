When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you would like to share your work, or when working with a team.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you dont accidentally overwrite something you are working on that isnt in the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks- cloning a remote onto your GitHub account
    Clones- copying a local or remote repo
    Branches- creating an alternate version of your master repo

    Forks- use to work on someone elses remote repo
    Clones- use to copy repo to your device
    Branches- use when working on new feature or something experimental

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To be able to compare your local repo to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    emailing code back and forth.  it would be harder.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When working on something experimental or a new feature.

Commands:

git remote  |    Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote add origin url |     Add a new remote location for the repository. Origin is the default name to use when you create only one remote location. Url should be the https url to the github repository.
git remote -v  |    Outputs the remote locations with verbose information (fetch and push urls)
git push origin master  |    Push the master branch to the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
git pull origin master  |    = Git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
git fetch origin  |    Get the changes from the remote location into the (hidden?) origin/master branch
