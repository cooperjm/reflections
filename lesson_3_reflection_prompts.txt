When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you would like to share your work, or when working with a team.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you dont accidentally overwrite something you are working on that isnt in the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks- cloning a remote onto your GitHub account
    Clones- copying a local or remote repo
    Branches- creating an alternate version of your master repo

    Forks- use to work on someone elses remote repo
    Clones- use to copy repo to your device
    Branches- use when working on new feature or something experimental

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
